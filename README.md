# SpanishWordsIOS
An IOS app for learning Spanish vocabulary

# Overview

App displays a random Spanish-English vocabulary card from 7740 that are hosted on the Firestore Cloud database.

Users can learn new words and save the ones they want to keep learning to their collection where they can revist them.

I want to help make more useful mobile apps for learning even when people don't have a lot of time. All they need to do is open the app for 30 seconds to learn a new spanish word
